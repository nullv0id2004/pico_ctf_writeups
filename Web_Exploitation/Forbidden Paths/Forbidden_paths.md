# Forbidden Paths
## Description
Can you get the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:64403/). We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
## Type: Web Exploitation
## Solving
1. First I opened the website.
2. Then I tried to read the absolute location of the file
`/usr/share/nginx/html/oliver-twist.txt` and since website is filtering absolute filtering it was not authorized.

        /usr/share/nginx/html/oliver-twist.txt
![](/Web_Exploitation/Forbidden%20Paths/Forbidden_paths_resources/fp1.png)![](/Web_Exploitation/Forbidden%20Paths/Forbidden_paths_resources/fp2.png)

3. Then I tried `Relative Path` with the Reference as the Current dir and and tried to read 

        oliver-twist.txt
    It opened up that txt file means it is able to read relative paths.
![](/Web_Exploitation/Forbidden%20Paths/Forbidden_paths_resources/fp3.png)
![](/Web_Exploitation/Forbidden%20Paths/Forbidden_paths_resources/fp4.png)

4. So since the Flag was in the root dir that is `/flag.txt` we can access that by using path traversing from current path.

        ../../../../flag.txt.

        Flag:picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}
